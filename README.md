*ksdots is based on davesdots*

This is a set of configuration files used by Kevin Lange. Many of these
are meant to be used on top of davesdots, replacing where necessary.

## bash ##
My bashrc, which has gone through two years of customization.

## screen ##
The provided `.screenrc` uses the minor control things that `davesdots`
provides, but with a different theme and some handlings for `C-tab`
(which will only work under `xterm`)


## X11 ##

An `.Xresources` is provided to give `xterm` a Tango color scheme and
rebind Control-tab and Control-Shift-tab so that `screen` can use them.
